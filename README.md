# Texture Classification of Colorectal Cancer Using Convolutional Squeeze-And-Excitation Network
This project built a deep learning model built in **convolutional neural network** framework with **squeeze-and-excitation blocks** for image classification of textures in colorectal cancer histology, based on [colorectal_histology](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/colorectal_histology) from tensorflow databases.
